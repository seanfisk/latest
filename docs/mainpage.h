/**
 * @mainpage Welcome to Latest's documentation!
 *
 * Latest is program to assist you in finding the last modified file in a
 * directory. I have created it for several purposes.
 *
 * Goals
 * -----
 *
 * - Improve my skill in C programming.
 * - Create a fully functioning project.
 * - Create something that might be useful to some people.
 *
 * - Develop using a test-driven development style of program.  Use tools
 *   developed by the embedded division of Atomic Object (my employer), located
 *   at [Throw the Switch!](http://throwtheswitch.org/).
 *
 * To really see how it works, give it a try!
