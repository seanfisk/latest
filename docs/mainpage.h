/**
 * @mainpage Welcome to Latest's documentation!
 *
 * Latest is program to assist you in finding the last modified file in a
 * directory. I have created it for several purposes.
 *
 * Goals
 * -----
 *
 * - Improve my skill in C programming.
 * - Create a fully functioning project.
 * - Create something that might be useful to some people.
 *
 * - Develop using a test-driven development style of program.  Use tools
 *   developed by the embedded division of Atomic Object (my employer), located
 *   at [Throw the Switch!][throw-the-switch].
 *
 * To really see how it works, give it a try!
 *
 * Compilation
 * -----------
 *
 * By default, Latest is configured to build with
 * [Clang][clang]. To build using [GCC][gcc], comment out the tools
 * section in `project.yml`. Then run the following:
 *
 *     rake release
 *
 * Documentation
 * -------------
 *
 * Documentation is created using Doxygen. Run the following to build it:
 *
 *     rake docs
 *     open docs/build/html/index.html
 *
 * Todo
 * ----
 *
 * Please see the [Todo list][todo].
