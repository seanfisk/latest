{"name":"Latest","body":"Latest is program to assist you in finding the last modified file in a\r\ndirectory. I have created it for several purposes.\r\n\r\nGoals\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- Improve my skill in C programming.\r\n- Create a fully functioning project.\r\n- Create something that might be useful to some people.\r\n- Develop using a test-driven development style of program.  Use tools developed\r\n  by the embedded division of Atomic Object (my employer), located at\r\n  [Throw the Switch!][].\r\n\r\nTo really see how it works, give it a try!\r\n\r\nCompilation\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nBy default, Latest is configured to build with [Clang][]. To build using\r\n[GCC][], comment out the tools section in `project.yml`. Then run the following:\r\n\r\n    rake release\r\n\r\nRegression Testing\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nRegression testing is done using [Ceedling][], [CMock][], and [Unity][]. Run the\r\ntest suite using the following:\r\n\r\n    rake test:all\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nDocumentation is created using Doxygen. Run the following to build it:\r\n\r\n    rake docs\r\n    open docs/build/html/index.html\r\n\r\n[Throw The Switch!]: http://throwtheswitch.org/\r\n[Clang]: http://clang.llvm.org/\r\n[GCC]: http://gcc.gnu.org/\r\n[Ceedling]: http://throwtheswitch.org/white-papers/ceedling-intro.html\r\n[CMock]: http://throwtheswitch.org/white-papers/cmock-intro.html\r\n[Unity]: http://throwtheswitch.org/white-papers/unity-intro.html\r\n","tagline":"Find your latest files, at the speed of light!
